// qml-syntax.test.ts proves each file PARSES. That is a weaker guarantee than
// it looks: a property bound to an id that does not exist is perfectly valid
// syntax and still fails on the desk. Verified — injecting
// `nonexistentThing.value` into InfoSettings produced zero syntax findings.
//
// This gate resolves the real imports instead (`qs.Commons`, `qs.Ui` and the
// Quickshell modules) so qmllint can tell whether a name actually exists.
//
// It gates on a per-file CEILING rather than zero, because the codebase carries
// hundreds of findings that are idiomatic or unmodellable rather than wrong:
// `[unqualified]` is how QML reads its own root properties, `PanelWindow` is
// created by the Quickshell runtime so qmllint calls it uncreatable, and
// BackgroundWallpaper.qml deliberately names `BackgroundMedia`, which only
// exists on an Omarchy with video wallpaper support — that file is loaded by
// URL precisely so its absence stays survivable.
//
// A ceiling still catches the case that matters: one new unresolvable
// reference moves the count, which is exactly what a bad merge introduces.
// Verified — the same injection took InfoModel from 5 to 6.
// Privacy adds unqualified bindings for the status chip and overlay hotkey.
// Container additions: one Process exit-status metadata warning, plus
// dynamic Style properties and unqualified card/delegate accesses.

  // the displayTitle calls already counted here. 607 folds in the FLEET
  // card's delegate (Repeater + required property + outer-scope

  // already produces ~26 of — see docs/fleet-remote-hosts.md.
  // 593 folds in the FLEET card's per-session rows: a second nested Repeater
  // with its own required property, so every outer-scope reference inside it
  // (view.desk, Style.spacing, the host delegate's own modelData) reads as
  // unqualified, plus the two layout-positioning warnings the existing status
  // dot already produces, for the session dot beside it. Same false-positive
  // shape as the row above it, counted twice because there are now two rows.
